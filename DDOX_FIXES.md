# DDOX Documentation Fixes

This branch adds fixes for various documentation issues in the DDOX-generated documentation.

## Fix for `std.algorithm.mutation.remove` examples

GitHub Issue: [#4007](https://github.com/dlang/dlang.org/issues/4007)

### Problem

The examples in the DDOX-generated documentation for `std.algorithm.mutation.remove` had several issues:

1. Missing `std.stdio` import for the examples that use `writeln`
2. Not showing that assignment of results back to a variable is necessary if you want to modify the original array
3. Some examples might show incorrect behavior due to improper formatting or explanation

### Solution

We've added a JavaScript fix that:

1. Adds a warning notice to the problematic examples explaining the need for imports
2. Clarifies that `remove` returns a new array but doesn't change the length of the original array
3. Shows proper usage with variable reassignment

This solution ensures that users understand how to correctly use the `remove` function while keeping the actual generated DDOX documentation intact.

### Future improvements

For a more permanent solution, consider:

1. Fixing the examples in the source code documentation in Phobos
2. Enhancing DDOX to validate examples and add necessary imports
3. Adding a preprocessing step that checks and fixes DDOX examples before generating the documentation
